 - Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find the block? =

Within the Gutenberg editor, + Add Block > Layouts > Tile

= Why is there space between the blocks in the editor but not the front end? =

Blocks need some padding in the editor for usability. The front end blocks will touch, creating the seamless Tile design.

= How do I get the image on the left, and the text on the right? =

Select the block.

The right hand side of the editor should be the Settings pane. If it's not present, hit the cog (gear wheel) in the top right to toggle view.

There's tabs for "Document" and "Block", click the latter.

Turn "Invert Layout" on.
