# Gutenberg Tile Block (Sword Layouts)

Tile Layout block for [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/) that helps create more interesting and modern WordPress pages.

Also see it in [WordPress.org/plugins/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sword-layouts/).

#### TILE

* Stagger small blurbs of text along side beautiful images
* Creates a "magazine" style to your webpage
* Fully responsive

The gaps between blocks are only in the Editor for block control reasons. [The front end](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidsword/sword-layouts/master/screenshot-1.gif) snugs everything up and creates the tile layout better.

* _this project is in a work in progress!_
